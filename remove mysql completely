Completely removing MySQL from Ubuntu involves stopping the service, removing packages, deleting configuration files, and optionally removing leftover data directories. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

Important Note: Before proceeding, ensure you have a backup of your databases if you need them. Uninstalling MySQL will erase all data.

    Stop MySQL Service:
    Use the following command to stop the MySQL service:
    Bash

    sudo systemctl stop mysql.service

    Use code with caution.

Remove MySQL Packages:
Run this command to remove the core MySQL packages and any version-specific packages:
Bash

sudo apt-get purge mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common mysql-server-core-* mysql-client-core-*

Use code with caution.

Remove MySQL User and Group (Optional):
   By default, Ubuntu creates a user and group for MySQL. You can remove them with:
Bash

sudo deluser mysql
sudo delgroup mysql

Use code with caution.

Remove MySQL Configuration and Data Files:
   Delete the configuration directory and data directory. Note that /var/lib/mysql stores your databases, so only proceed if you're sure about data loss.
Bash

sudo rm -rf /etc/mysql /var/lib/mysql

Use code with caution.

Remove Additional Packages (Optional):
This step removes any unused dependencies left behind by MySQL:
Bash

sudo apt-get autoremove

Use code with caution.

Update Repository Information (Optional):
Update your package lists after making changes:
Bash

sudo apt-get update

Use code with caution.

Remember, these steps will completely remove MySQL and its data. Make sure you have a backup if necessary. If you encounter any issues, you can refer to online resources for more detailed instructions specific to your Ubuntu version.
